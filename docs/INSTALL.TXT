The akismet extension is meant to provide spam protection in cases where content objects (comments, trackback, etc) can be added by visitors.


1. Unzip the files, copy them to the "extension/" directory of eZ Publish;

2. Activate the extension in the admin interface;

3. Modify the akismet.ini.append.php file:
	1. Get api key at: http://akismet.com/personal/, and add it to the APIKey setting;
	2. Define your BlogURL;
	3. Define all classes that should make use of the Akismet service in the InformationExtractorSettings setting;
	4. Map 'author','email', 'website' and 'body' to the content class attribute identifiers of the classes above. 
	   
	   The format is:
	   
	   [classIdentifier_AkismetSettings]
	   AuthorAttribute=classAttributeIdentifier
	   
	   for example:
	   
	   [comment_AkismetSettings]
	   AuthorAttribute=author

4. Create a workflow with the " Event / Akismet Spam filter" event, called by the 'publish/before' trigger.
