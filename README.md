Akismet extension README
------------------------

The akismet workflow extension is meant to provide 'post publish' spam protection in cases where content objects (comments, trackback, etc) can be added by visitors.


# Differences
---------------

This extension differs from the version by Kristof Coomans:

- It is not integrated with the ez approval workflow, but can of course be combined with the approval workflow;

- It does not require custom information extrator php classes, but can be configured in the configuration file;

- It uses the PHP5 version of the Akismet class developed by Bret Kuhns, improving performance;

- The name of the module view 'akismet/submit' has been changed to 'akismet/reportspam';
