The akismet extension is meant to provide 'post publish' spam protection in cases where content objects (comments, trackback, etc) can be added by visitors.

This extension differs from the version by Kristof Coomans:
- It is not integrated with the ez approval workflow, but can of course be combined with the approval workflow;
- It does not require custom information extrator php classes, but can be configured in the configuration file;
- It uses the PHP5 version of the Akismet class developed by Bret Kuhns, improving performance;
- The name of the module view 'akismet/submit' has been changed to 'akismet/reportspam';
